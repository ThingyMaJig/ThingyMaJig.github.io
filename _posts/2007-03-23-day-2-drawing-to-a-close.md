<p>Well thats it - this year's <strong>DrupalCon</strong> hosted by <em>Yahoo!</em> at their <strong>Open Source CMS Summit 2007</strong> is over. Winding up the conference are the <strong>Lullabot</strong> guy's doing their <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/audiocast/drupal_podcast_no_35_live_from_yahoo" title="Lullabot podcast 35 from DrupalCon at the Yahoo OSCMS Summit">podcast</a>.</p>

<p>I've really enjoyed this conference and have gained so much from it, from knowledge gained through the fantastic talks to something as simple as putting a face to a name (IRC or real) and making contacts. I'm writing this up during the talk and, ironically, the above point of putting names to faces was just brought up (you'll hear it in the podcast).</p>
<p>On top of the conference just being all-round great I've also really enjoyed my stay in America and, dare I say it, I've got to the point where I'd actually really like to live here. Everything is about half the price it is in the UK. The weather is nicer. The people are (or at least seem) more friendly. I'm sure I'll think of a legitimate reason for wanting to live in the UK at some point (excluding obvious reasons like family, friends and loved ones).</p>
