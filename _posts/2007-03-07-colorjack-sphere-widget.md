<h2>So what is it really?</h2>
<p>Well if you've ever tried designing a website, you might find it difficult to pick a set of colours which dont make you feel like vomiting or averting your eyes from the screen. I know I have (in the past) and its not nice. Some people find it very easy - but these people are natural artists whereas I know that I am not. I am a techie geek through and through and unless something is easily calculated or there is a logical path through to a conclusion, I find it quite hard to understand.</p>
<p>This tool is a godsend for anyone who needs to pick some colours for a website, so why not save yourself some time and get over to <a title="Colorjack - a fantastic free colour picker" href="http://www.colorjack.com/">Colorjack</a> and try out the free online tools (the <a href="http://www.colorjack.com/sphere/">Sphere</a> and <a href="http://www.colorjack.com/studio/">Studio</a>) or, if you have a Mac (as all people should), grab the Dashboard Widget too!</p>
