<p>With some help from a good friend, I took my first steps into <em>game-making</em> using <strong>C++</strong> last night. I used a graphics engine called <a title="Ogre3D Graphics Engine" href="http://www.ogre3d.org/"><strong>Ogre3D</strong></a> and tried to mimic a game I started making in <a title="Dark Basic Pro related topics" href="/tags/dbp"><strong>Dark Basic Pro</strong></a> a few weeks ago. To my astonishment, within a few hours I'd managed to replicate the basic layout of the game using tools which cost <strong style="text-decoration:underline">absolutely nothing</strong>!</p>

<p>Firstly I'd really like to thank my friend for all his patience and help - without him I wouldn't have known where to start!</p>
<p>Secondly - I'd like to list all the tools I used for this <em>first step</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong><a title="Visual Studio Express 2005 - by Microsoft" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/">Visual Studio Express 2005</a></strong></em> - a free C++ IDE and compiler by Microsoft.</li>
    <li><em><strong><a title="Ogre3D - a free and cross platform Graphics engine" href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">Ogre3D</a></strong></em> - the 3D Engine. It can handle OpenGL and DirectX, making it (in theory) cross-platform.</li>
    <li><em><strong><a title="Blender - a free 3D modelling application" href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a></strong></em> - A free 3D Modelling application.</li>
    <li><em><strong><a title="Textures included with Dark Basic Pro are Royalty Free" href="http://darkbasic.thegamecreators.com/">Textures included with Dark Basic Pro</a></strong></em> - although DBP isn't free itself, I already own it so for me the textures were as good as free for this project.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's pretty much it!</p>
<p>The game I was making in <em><strong>Dark Basic Pro</strong></em> was a simple game where you had a random set of boxes on a &quot;map&quot; and you couldn't see your enemy unless you had direct line-of-sight. This game also had network capability which I'm not even going to consider touching yet until my C++/Blender foundations are more secure.</p>
<p>Below I attach some screenshots showing the progression of my learning...</p>
