  provide and it is a good codebase with a LOT of content. This codebase, however,
  offers more&nbsp; &quot;<em>Web 2.0</em>&quot; features such as <strong>free tagging</strong>,
  <strong>comments</strong> and <strong>rating</strong> (and I've only just got started
  - more to come!).</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"Codebase - the Dark Basic Pro Community Programming

<p>I have many more plans for this site - the next big &quot;invention&quot; on it will be completely customized user profile pages. These profile pages will resemble a Facebook profile more than a Drupal Profile page.</p>
<p>I am personally very happy with the design - its quite unique (I know the backgrounds are a little bit matrix-like) - I've never seen a website with this design.</p>
<p>Why not take a browse around the site? If you see any code you're interested in - you can get a <a title="Free Dark Basic Pro Demo" href="http://darkbasicpro.thegamecreators.com/?f=trial"><strong>free</strong>, <em>no strings attached</em>, <strong>demo</strong></a> of <em><strong>Dark Basic Pro</strong></em> from <em><strong>The Games Creators</strong></em> website.</p>
