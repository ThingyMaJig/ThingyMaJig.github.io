excerpt: "<p>I've only seen Most Haunted a few times on TV and generally thought it
  was pretty poor. My opinion was based on the grounds that if you place a group of
  people in a dark and creaky house, tell them there are ghosts, turn the lights out
  and pay them to scream at a camera then they're bound to... well.. scream at the
  camera. I'm clearly not the only one who thinks this!</p>\r\n<p>Now this video might
  not be to everyone's taste - so if you dont like Fart Jokes, it wont be for you!</p>"
