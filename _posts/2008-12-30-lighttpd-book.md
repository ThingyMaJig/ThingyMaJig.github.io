<p>As many readers might know, I use <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/"><strong>Lighttpd</strong></a> a lot. I really like it for many reasons. Its fast, free, easy to configure, very light-weight (handy if you're running a cheap VPS or a low end server)&hellip; This is very apt for me because almost EVERY website I make now is a Drupal site (why would you use anything else?!).</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/"><strong>Drupal</strong></a> is, inherently, a rather large web app - mainly because of its ability to do nigh-on anything. This means one needs to be a little careful about what you do with your resources. From my experience, Apache (which is bloody brilliant) can tend to get a little &quot;bloated&quot;. I know there are ways of slimming it down and improving it, but I also like playing with new toys too!

<p>When I installed Lighttpd, the only resources I could easily find were via <a title="Information about Lighttpd on Google" href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=lighttpd+tutorial">Googling</a>. This is fine (and free) but is quite <em>sparse</em> in nature; one blog tells you how to configure and install Lighttpd and another will tell you <a href="http://realize.be/drupal-lighttpd-clean-urls-made-easy">how to setup LUA&nbsp;to work with Drupal</a>.</p>
<p>Now those great guys at <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/"><strong>Packt Publishing</strong></a> have produced <a title="Book about Lighttpd" href="http://www.packtpub.com/lighttpd/book"><strong>a book about Lighttpd</strong></a>. This 223 page reference and tutorial will guide you through topics such as <strong><em>Installing Lighttpd</em></strong> and <em>Migration From Apache</em> through to more advanced stuff like configuring it for use with common web apps like <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> and securing it using technologies like SSL. There are also sections on using <a href="http://www.lua.org/">LUA</a>&nbsp;(which is necessary for <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> folks who want clean URL's) and writing custom addons for the Lighttpd API (something I've not personally wanted or needed to do&hellip; yet, but handy to know its there!)</p>
<p>This is definately a book I'm going to look into buying&hellip; and I, generally speaking, don't &quot;<em>do</em>&quot; books!</p>
