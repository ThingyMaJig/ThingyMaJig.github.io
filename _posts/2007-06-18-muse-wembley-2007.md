<p>A day later than I wanted to but here are some photos I took while at the Saturday Muse concert at Wembley Stadium - the first sell-out show at the new venue in North London. They're also the first &quot;proper band&quot; to play there (George Michael is a solo artist).</p>

<p style="clear: left;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas-thompson/561932201/in/set-72157600383976249/"><img width="240" height="180" border="0" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1409/561932201_2085c0e931_m.jpg" alt="Concrete Plant outside Wembley Stadium" title="Concrete Plant outside Wembley Stadium" /></a> It must have taken so much concrete to build Wembley that they had to build a dedicated concrete plant outside!</p>
<p style="clear: left;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas-thompson/561932667/in/set-72157600383976249/"><img width="240" height="60" border="0" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1400/561932667_94bf01e743_m.jpg" alt="Inside Wembley Stadium - Panoramic - Early" title="Inside Wembley Stadium - Panoramic - Early" /></a> This is a panoramic of Wembley Stadium before anything &quot;<em>interesting</em>&quot; happened.</p>
<p style="clear: left;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas-thompson/561933019/in/set-72157600383976249/"><img width="240" height="60" border="0" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1313/561933019_99bb9fe339_m.jpg" alt="Inside Wembley Stadium - Panoramic - later" title="Wembley Stadium - Panoramic - later" /></a> This is a similar panoramic from the same position taken a little during one of the warm-ups.</p>
<p style="clear: left;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas-thompson/561486264/in/set-72157600383976249/"><img width="240" height="180" border="0" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1224/561486264_ea8ad6fd13_m.jpg" alt="Stage before Muse" title="Stage before Muse" /></a> This is the stage, just before Muse came on.</p>
<p style="clear: left;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas-thompson/561487600/in/set-72157600383976249/"><img width="240" height="180" border="0" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1434/561487600_ab59be010d_m.jpg" alt="Finally Muse!" title="Finally Muse!" /></a> Finally - Muse! You can just about make out someone wearing red on the stage.</p>
<p style="clear: left;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas-thompson/561488762/in/set-72157600383976249/"><img width="240" height="180" border="0" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1135/561488762_d3ca982269_m.jpg" alt="Muse playing with Glowing Orbs in background" title="Muse playing with Glowing Orbs in background" /></a> These are the glowing orbs in the background of the stage - they changed colour depending on the song.</p>
<p style="clear: left;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas-thompson/561937311/in/set-72157600383976249/"><img width="240" height="180" border="0" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1021/561937311_bb969b86c5_m.jpg" alt="Photo of Orbs, shot with flash" title="Photo of Orbs, shot with flash" /></a> I tried taking a photo of the orbs with a flash but, as you can see, a K800i flash isn't quite powerful enough to light up <strong>Wembley Stadium</strong>!</p>
<p style="clear: left;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas-thompson/561491124/in/set-72157600383976249/"><img width="240" height="180" border="0" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1377/561491124_b7b6fd2ac1_m.jpg" alt="Lights? No! They're mobile phones!" title="Lights? No! They're mobile phones!" /></a> One of the last songs was a slower song (I forget which song) and everyone got their mobile phones out. Gone are the day's of lighters being used!</p>
<p style="clear: left;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas-thompson/561939697/in/set-72157600383976249/"><img width="240" height="180" border="0" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1285/561939697_0a9a6510d7_m.jpg" alt="Similar Mobile Phone Lights Shot" title="Similar Mobile Phone Lights Shot" /></a> As much as it might seem geeky to find mobile phone light romantic, you have to admit it does look quite beautiful.</p>
<p style="clear: left;">I thought this concert was one of the best I've been to. They EASILY out did their performance at Wembley Arena last year - and thats something I never thought I'd see!</p>
