<p>Amongst his <em>minimalist content</em> you will see 3 sets of fantastic icons which are completely free (within the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/" title="Creative Commons license 2.5">Creative Commons 2.5 License</a>).</p>
<p>There are 3 sets&hellip;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Silk</li>
    <li>Flags</li>
    <li>Mini</li>
</ul>
<p>There also seems to be a set called <em>Bitsy</em> on its way too!</p>
<p>Mark - keep up the fantastic work! Those icons are fab-tastic!</p>
