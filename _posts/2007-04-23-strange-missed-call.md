<p>Sitting in work on a Monday morning and I just received a call on my mobile phone from an unknown number: <em><strong>0701 2183144</strong></em>. I didn't get to answer it as they hung up before my ringtone even had a chance to kick in - not that I would have answered that anyway&hellip;</p>

<p>Has anyone else ever had a call from this number before? A quick bit of research led me to an <a title="uk.telecom FAQ part 2 (flextel)" href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/uk-telecom/part2/">FAQ's page about uk telecom</a> and it seems to be related to a company called <a title="Flextel homepage" href="http://www.flextel.co.uk/">Flextel</a> who provide custom numbers mapped to other numbers.</p>
