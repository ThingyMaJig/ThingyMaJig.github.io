<p>This evening I went out to a pub called <strong><em>The Woodman</em></strong> in <em>Ide Hill</em> with my Uncle and his friend. Its been a while since I've been out to a nice pub and this one certainly is a nice pub!</p>

<p>The food was unbelievable. They have a standard menu and a chalkboard of daily specials ranging from steak's to fish based meals to good quality home-cooked food. I chose to have Liver and Bacon with Onions on a bed of mash. My uncle had Scampi and Chips and his friend just had a prawn cocktail starter (he'd eaten before going out). My meal was faultless and, dare I say it, the best liver and bacon I've even eaten!</p>
<p>The deserts were equally, if not more, fantastic. My uncle had Tiramasu and I had Orange and Cointreau Brullee. It was unbelievable!</p>
<p>All in all - it was a brilliant meal and I really would like to go back there again&hellip; All I need to do is find a route I can remember!</p>

<h2>I cant use that - where else can I look?</h2>
<p>Well - if you cant be pleased with an embedded Google Map then what else can I do?! Oh yeah&hellip; I know&hellip; They have their own website - <a href="http://www.thewoodman-idehill.co.uk/" title="The Woodman's homepage">http://www.thewoodman-idehill.co.uk/</a> - which I must say is quite a nice one, in my opinion.</p>
