excerpt: "<p>I've just released a new game - its a VERY simple adaptation of the classic,
  pong, but it has a twist in the form of tennis. You must rally the ball back and
  forth - the ball gaining speed slightly on every return. Players win points (and
  serve) by knocking the ball past their opponent, either through a cunning move or
  by making them lose out in a game of reactions.</p>\r\n<p>Checkout the game here
