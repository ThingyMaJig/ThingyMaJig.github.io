<p>Its been a while since a I posted and mostly thats because I've been moving home and without internet... So whats new? Well I bought myself a <em><strong>Nintendo Wii</strong></em> on Sunday as I've been toying with the idea for a while. My initial thoughts on it are: <strong>IT'S SO MUCH FUN</strong>!</p>
<p>The only downside I have found so far is that it wont play DVD Films... It has a DVD <em>drive </em>- but they just haven't made it play films... Why? I have no idea!</p>

<p>I bought it from Game for about &pound;200 which included the standard issue box with the <strong>Wii Sports bundle</strong> which includes <em>Baseball</em>, <em>Bowling</em>, <em>Tennis</em>, <em>Boxing </em>and <em>Golf</em>. Out of these I haven't played Golf yet, however Bowling is definately my favourite!</p>
<p>I also got <em><strong>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2008</strong></em> which is still in its wrapper, but looks good!</p>
<p>Over the coming weeks I'm gonna be exploring the Wii more and more and I'll be posting up game reviews for the ones I play + anything else I think is cool!</p>
<p>I'd also appreciate any advice other Wii players have out there.</p>
