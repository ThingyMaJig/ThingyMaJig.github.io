<p>Finally, last night she was playing about with the camera and took these lovely warm photo's on a candle and a burning match.</p>

<p>Flickr has the full sized images from the camera - I'm amazed at the quality! Most of the early photo's were taken in auto mode, but the dark candle/match ones were taken using some manual overrides on the exposure, aperture and ISO settings.</p>
