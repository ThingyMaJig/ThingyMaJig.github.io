<p>My first theme, <a title="Abssive for Drupal 5 &amp; 6" href="http://drupal.org/project/abessive">Abessive</a>, gets a new release today for Drupal 6. Turns out to be a pretty easy upgrade!</p>
<p>In case nobody caught onto what <a title="Abssive for Drupal 5 &amp; 6" href="http://drupal.org/project/abessive">Abessive</a> was the <a title="Initial Abessive release announcement" href="/blog/12-06-2008/my-first-drupal-theme">first time</a>; it is an (almost) image free theme with flexible 1, 2 or 3 column layout (depending on where/if you place any blocks).

<p>The theme has been tested in many browsers and only IE6 (as usual) has compatibility issues involving inexplicable columns positioning (<a title="Abessive for IE6 Issue" href="http://drupal.org/node/304146">patches welcome</a>!).</p>
<p>I'd like to implement some kind of control panel for this module to allow easy customization of the gradients, backgrounds and border colours (rather like Color provides for Garland).</p>
<p>This theme is also <em>SEO Friendly</em>. By this I mean that the configuration of the HTML in the content <em>forces</em> the <strong>content</strong> to be rendered before the side-menu's. Afterall, <strong><em>content is king</em></strong> and that's what people are looking for! :-)</p>
