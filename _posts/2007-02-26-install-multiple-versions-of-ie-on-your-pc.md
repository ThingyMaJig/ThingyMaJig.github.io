<p>I recently wanted to try out my drupal websites in IE 6.0 (and ideally 5.55 too, for compatibility) however since IE7 was released, its been harder and harder to find a computer with IE6 left on it!</p>
<p>Step in: <strong><a href="http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE" title="MultipleIE">Multipel_IE</a></strong></p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>I think the best way to describe this fantastically easy to use tool is to quote their website:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE">
<p><strong>Ever wanted to test your website in various versions of Internet Explorer?</strong></p>
[adsense:468x60:4496506397]
<p>It is possible to run Internet Explorer in standalone mode without having to over-write previous versions thanks to <a href="http://archivist.incutio.com/viewlist/css-discuss/33150" title="Multiple Version of IE in Windows XP Pro">Joe Maddalone</a> who came up with a way of achieving that in November 2003. Basically, Internet Explorer is run by exploiting a known workaround to DLL hell - which was introduced in Windows 2000 and later versions - called DLL redirection.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/multiIE.html" title="Taming Your Multiple IE Standalones">Manfred Staudinger</a> perfected the standalone versions by adding IE version numbers to the title bar of the standalone browser window. Moreover, by removing the &quot;IE&quot; key in the registry subkey <code>[HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Version Vector]</code> Internet Explore defaulted to respecting conditional comments based on the version number prebuilt in the program.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to follow the instructions and get any version of IE running in standalone along side other versions. Most of you probably know of <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/?ie/32bit/standalone" title="Evolt IE Archive">evolt's archive of Internet Explorer</a> which has them readily packaged in ZIP files. Now suppose you want to download them all. An installer that would conveniently automate the whole process would be great. Thanks to <a href="http://tredosoft.com/node/25#comment-512" title="Could you do an install for older IE versions too?">this comment</a> for the idea.</p>
<p>So I made an installer which contains IE3 IE4.01 IE5 IE5.5 and IE6</p>
