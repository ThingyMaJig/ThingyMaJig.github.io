<p><em>RRD::Simple</em> provides a simple interface to RRDTool's RRDs module. This module does not currently offer fetch method that is available in the RRDs module. It does however create RRD files with a sensible set of default RRA (Round Robin Archive) definitions, and can dynamically add new data source names to an existing RRD file.</p>
