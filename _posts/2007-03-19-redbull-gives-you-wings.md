<p>At the first race of the <em>FIA Formula 1</em> season, <strong>David Coulthard</strong> seems to have been drinking too much of his sponsor's (<strong>Redbull</strong>) product. He tried to pull off an absolutely ridiculous move on <strong>Alexander Wurz</strong> which ended up with him being launched, literally, off the cockpit of Wurz's car!</p>

<p>From the video (courtesy of <a href="http://youtube.com/user/DaVinCinl1">DaVinCinl1</a> from YouTube), you can see from a few angles how close <strong>Coulthard</strong> came to decapitating <strong>Wurz</strong>.</p>

<p>When exactly is <strong>David Coulthard</strong> going to retire from F1? Between him and <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenson_Button" title="Jenson Button on Wikipedia">Jenson Button</a></strong>'s bad luck with reliability - its no wonder we've won nothing in F1 since <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Mansell" title="Nigel Mansell on Wikipedia">Nigel Mansell</a></strong> upped and left for the Indi series!</p>
<p>At least we seem to have a promising talent in McLaren's prot&eacute;g&eacute; <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong>. 3rd place in his first race - pretty good!</p>
