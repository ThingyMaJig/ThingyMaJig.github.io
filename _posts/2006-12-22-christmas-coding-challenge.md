<p>This is from the site&hellip;</p>
<h2>The rules</h2>
<p>This is a one off, so there are a couple of changes to the normal rules. Firstly, the <em>christmas-smilie</em> image must be used in some way. To keep things simple, the image will be included as data at the end of your entry, and converted using a data-to-image function (see below). This means no loading of files is necessary, and all entries can be tested with the usual copy-paste-execute technique.</p>
<p>Secondly, the judging will be done by a special guest judge&hellip; I've yet to get that finalised but I'm hoping one of the moderators is going to kindly step up there.</p>
<h2>The Deadline</h2>
<p>You have until the end of 2006! That's two weeks and a day.</p>
