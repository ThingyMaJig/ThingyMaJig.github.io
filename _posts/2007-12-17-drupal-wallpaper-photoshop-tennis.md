<p>After <a href="http://drupal.org/user/25701">Matt Farnia</a> posted about <a href="http://www.mattfarina.com/2007/12/14/drupal-wallpaper">the utter lack of Drupal Wallpapers</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/user/97634">my friend</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/user/59351">I</a> decided to have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoshop_contest#Photoshop_tennis">Photoshop Tennis</a> contest.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Basically, a <em>Photoshop Tennis</em> contest involves, after maybe setting some ground rules like a consistent theme or having to use a certain image/logo in each design, person A making a design and passing it (or '<em>serving</em>' it) to person B. Person B then has to make an altered version of that image, keeping in line with the rules you agree. Person B then plays the image back to Person A. This gets repeated for a predetermined number of rounds (or the players get bored) and a winner is decided. The winner can be decided by the players or by an independent judge who scores based on the number of 'best shots' - you sometimes don't even NEED a winner as it is, after all, just a bit of fun!</p>

<p>Anyway - <a href="http://drupal.org/user/97634">my friend</a> served first and <a href="http://drupal.org/user/59351">I</a> have to make a return shot on these (I put together <a href="http://fc05.deviantart.com/fs24/i/2007/351/d/c/Drupal_Wallpapers___V1_by_njt1982.png" title="Wallpaper Pack Preview">the preview</a>)&hellip;</p>

<p>I've also posted about this on the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/201693" title="Drupal Wallpapers">Drupal.org forum</a> where, hopefully, they might inspire more people to create some Drupal wallpapers! It would also be nice if it appeared on the frontpage (if any moderators read this... *hint thint*... ;-) hehe)</p>
