<p>Did anyone else get a Drupal EyeGrow (or <a href="http://acquia.com/blog/druplipet-drupal-chia-pet">Druplipets as they seem to be known</a>)&nbsp;from DrupalCon CPH?</p>
<p>I started growing mine around a week ago and, as you can see, it's coming on pretty well!</p>

<p>I know <a href="http://menusandblocks.co.uk/">Chris Maidon</a> (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/81488">Matason</a>) has started growing his too, so I thought it'd be pretty neat to have a Flickr Group for it. If anyone wishes to share some pics, please post them to the <a title="Drupal EyeGrow's on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/drupal-eyegrow/">Flickr Drupal EyeGrow Group</a>. It's completely free to join Flickr and the Group, it'll be a great way to share in post-DrupalCon gardening!</p>
