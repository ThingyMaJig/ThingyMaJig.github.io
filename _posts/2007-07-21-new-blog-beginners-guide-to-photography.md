<p>Ever wanted to start taking good photo's? Ever wondered what the <em>ISO setting</em>, <em>Exposure Time</em> or that little symbol of a flower on your camera meant?

<p>As of writing this there are two good &quot;introduction to&quot; articles and there are plans for many more to come. The first of these is called <a href="http://www.kate-harris.co.uk/exploring-the-camera-basic-stuff-5" title="How to use the 7 basic modes on the Canon EOS 400D"><em>Exploring the Camera - Basic Stuff</em></a> and covers the 7 main modes of the <em><strong>Canon EOS 400D</strong></em> which are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fully Automatic</li>
    <li>Portrait Mode</li>
    <li>Landscape Mode</li>
    <li>Macro/Close-up Mode</li>
    <li>Sports Mode</li>
    <li>Night Portrait Mode</li>
    <li>No-Flash Mode</li>
</ul>
<p>This article also contains several example photo's.</p>
<p>The second and most recent article is titles <a href="http://www.kate-harris.co.uk/technical-terms-iso-basically-explained-6" title="How to use the ISO settings on a Canon EOS 400D"><em>Technical Terms - ISO Basically Explained</em></a> and covers the <em>ISO Settings</em> and <em>Shutter Speed</em> settings on the camera and how tweaking these values can completely change the outcome of your photo.</p>
<p>This blog is still very early in its development but I think its going to be a fantastic resource for those who are looking to start a hobby as photography.</p>
