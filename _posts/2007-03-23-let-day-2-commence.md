<p>Well Day 2 is starting soon. Lets see what this beautiful new day brings!</p>
<p>I'm really torn about what talks to do today. The first scheduled talks are really clashing! I want go to both the <strong>Drupal Lightning</strong> and the <strong>Drupal Profiles</strong> talk. After that, I think the <strong>Yahoo Pipes</strong> session sounds interesting. Then I'm torn between the <strong>FormsAPI</strong> talk and the <strong>Date + Calander</strong> talk.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>After lunch, I'm torn between the <strong>Wiki</strong> talk and the <strong>jQuery</strong> talk. The 3 o'clock slot is no different - talks on <strong>AHAH</strong>, <strong>Developer Eye for the Design Guy</strong> and <strong>Building a CCK Module</strong> all clash. The last session has just as many clashes - <strong>The Lullabot Podcast</strong> is being done as well as a talk on using <strong>The Flickr API</strong> and <strong>Site Structure and Navigation</strong>.</p>
