<p><strong>Drupal 5.0 is out!</strong></p>
<p>Get yourself over to&hellip;</p>

<p>What a fantastic coincidence - releasing Drupal 5.0 on its 6th birthday... Its like it was planned or something!</p>

<blockquote cite="http://drupal.org/drupal-5.0">
<p>After 8 months of development we are ready to release Drupal 5.0 to the world. Today is also Drupal's 6th birthday, so the timing could not be more perfect. Drupal 4.0 was released in 2002 and finally we feel confident to increase the major version number from 4 to 5.</p>

<p>Drupal powers sites across the web, ranging from the personal weblog of Tim Berners-Lee, podcast sites like TWIT.tv, community driven sites like SpreadFireFox.com, artist communities like Terminus 1525 to large media sites like TheOnion.com, MTV and even sites for NASA.</p>

<p>There have been over 492 contributors to the Drupal 5.0 release submitting 1173 patches, which is 150 more people than our previous record with Drupal 4.7. These new contributions are seen in the major usability improvements, a new Drupal core theme, a web-based installer, and expansion of the Drupal development framework that will afford themers and contributing developers even greater flexibility and power.</p>
