<p>This site collects reports of LCD TV, window, beer glass etc. broken by a fly-away Wii remote.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>The site describes itself as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wii Damage is the place to come for all your Wii-related bashes, bruises and breakages.</p>
  <p>Don’t get us wrong, we love this thing!</p>
  <p>But like those corny home video shows, there’s something compelling about the havoc that can be wrought in our own living rooms, all in the name of fun, and it is our duty to record it here for your amusement and information.</p>
