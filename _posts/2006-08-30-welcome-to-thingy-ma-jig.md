<p>Welcome to <a href="http://www.thingy-ma-jig.co.uk/">TMJ</a>. This site contains the work and thoughts of its owner, <strong><em>Nicholas Thompson</em></strong>. This is version 3 of <strong>Thingy Ma Jig</strong>. It started out being a table-based hand written site with very basic features. I then started to write version 2 with more features which I learned since starting version 1. Since then I have been introduced to <strong><a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a></strong> which is, in my opinion, the best content management system available (or at least for free).</p>
<p>This is a drupal powered site which currently contains a few <em>Dark Basic Pro</em> programs and games I've written (I hope to upload MANY more), a blog which I have just started and some RSS feeds from some sites (down the right).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dbp-site.com">DBP-Site.com</a> is a site, again drupal powered, which I designed to catalogue the challenge results of the Dark Basic Pro Challenges Thread which has been going for well over a year now.</p>
<p>If you have any comments and/or suggestions for this site, please leave a comment on this post as I'd be interested to hear from you.</p>
<p>Anyway - best do something productive now&hellip;</p>
