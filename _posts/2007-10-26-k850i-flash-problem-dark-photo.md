<p>Maybe it will be fixed during a firmware update? My version is:</p>
<p><code>1200-4400 R1CA029 070922</code></p>
<p>I assume that last number is a datestame in the form YYMMDD which means the firmware is about 5 weeks old (nearly).</p>
<p>I'll post back if I find anything out, but in the mean time I'd appreciate to hear from other people!</p>
