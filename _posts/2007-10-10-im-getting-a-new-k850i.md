<p>I just got off the phone with the <strong>O2</strong> Upgrades team. I suggested that I was interested in either the <a href="/tags/n95" title="Nokia N95 related content">Nokia N95</a> OR the <a title="Sony Ericsson k850i related articles" href="/tags/k850i">Sony Ericsson k850i</a>. I was informed that neither the <a href="/tags/n95" title="Nokia N95 related content">N95</a> or <a title="Sony Ericsson k850i related articles" href="/tags/k850i">k850i</a> could not be done for free on the budget/contract I was asking for so I asked to be put through to the <em>retention team</em>. After being on hold for a few minutes the call was retrieved from the abyss that was the call waiting queue and I got a good offer&hellip;</p>
<!--break-->
<p>I was told that I could get the <a title="Sony Ericsson k850i related articles" href="/tags/k850i">k850i</a> for free! Here is the summary:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Free <a title="Sony Ericsson k850i related articles" href="/tags/k850i">k850i</a></li>
    <li>12 month contract</li>
    <li>&pound;30 per month</li>
    <li>500 texts</li>
    <li>500 anytime/network minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, for me, that is not a bad deal (considering the <a title="Sony Ericsson k850i related articles" href="/tags/k850i">k850i</a> has just come out!). I was informed that this was a 'special offer' from an old 12 month contract. <strong>O2</strong> claim to be phasing out 12 month contracts and this was a contract introduced a year ago and taken off the shelf when the new 18 month deals came out recently.</p>
<p>As soon as I get my new phone I'll be posting up some shots that the camera is capable of and a review of its facilities. Cant wait!</p>
<h2>UPDATE:</h2>
<p>Looks like I WILL have to wait! The phone is out of stock and O2 will be getting a delivery on the 15th October&nbsp; (Monday) so it should be despatched on that day.</p>
