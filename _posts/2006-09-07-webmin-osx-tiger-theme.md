<p>I recently found an <a title="OSX Webmin Theme" href="http://www.stress-free.co.nz/webmin-theme">OSX Webmin Theme</a> which has some REALLY neat features, like javascript based drop-down menu's, a much cleaner and sharper look-n-feel, a spotlight-like AJAX based search facility and more&hellip;</p>
<p>I personally think its one of the best themes I've seen for Webmin and I challenge anyone to prove me wrong!! Seriously&hellip; I do&hellip; :-)</p>
