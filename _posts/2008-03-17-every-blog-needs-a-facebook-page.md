<p>Every blog worth its weight needs a Facebook page!</p> <p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Thingy-Ma-Jig-A-Blog-of-Drupal-Technology-and-General-Bloginess/22760952880" title="ThingyMaJig's Facebook Page">http://www.facebook.com/pages/Thingy-Ma-Jig...../22760952880</a></p> <p>Lets see how many fans I get! This is also a test in a way. I wanna see if Facebook could provice any kind of useful traffic.</p> <!--break--> <p>Now the question is - how can my website &quot;talk back&quot; to facebook? How can I get it to automatically post these fantastic blog entries I write to the page? Has someone written an API module? Surely they must have!</p> <!--break-->
