<p>Every blog worth its weight needs a Facebook page!</p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThingyMaJig.co.uk/">https://www.facebook.com/ThingyMaJig.co.uk/</a></p> <p>Lets see how many fans I get! This is also a test in a way. I wanna see if Facebook could provice any kind of useful traffic.</p><p>Now the question is - how can my website &quot;talk back&quot; to facebook? How can I get it to automatically post these fantastic blog entries I write to the page? Has someone written an API module? Surely they must have!</p>
