<h2>Sony Ericsson K800i</h2>
<p>Lets start with this device - and lets face it, its out of its league. Its a phone - its not a dedicated camera. But bearing that in mind, it holds its own pretty well! These are the two photo's taken.</p>
<div><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/nicholas-thompson/542984858/" title="Photo Sharing"><img width="240" height="180" border="0" title="K800i - Flower" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1328/542984858_8afd1b4b9f_m.jpg" alt="K800i - Rose" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/nicholas-thompson/542984852/" title="Photo Sharing"><img width="240" height="180" border="0" title="K800i - Cactus" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1018/542984852_5818941ac3_m.jpg" alt="K800i - Cactus" /></a></div>
<p>Ok... They're not bad really. At 3 Megapixels, it has the least detail of the 3 camera and, upon closer inspection, it looks like the JPEG compression is pretty poor too. Also, possibly due to the small size of the lens/sensor, the cactus photo is blurred due to an exposure time of 1/30th of a second (which is pretty high for an outdoor photo).</p>
<h2>Nikon E4600</h2>
<p>This is a camera I have used for years and was a step up from a Jenoptiks budget digital camera what was absolutely pathetic. When I upgraded to the Nikon I was immediately impressed with the quality of the photo, however I think its starting to show its ages - hence it not really being sold anywhere anymore!</p>

<p>Clearly these are better photo's - the camera has a much better lense for starters. However, the Cactus photo (same light and position - no flash) required over twice the exposure time - 5/82 seconds (about 0.062s). The colours are much better though - this can especially be seen with the Rose photo. The K800i really washed the colours out.</p>
<h2>Canon EOS 400D</h2>
<p>Now prepare to be stunned!</p>

<p>WOW! Just look at all that extra colour that the <strong>Canon</strong> found in the rose! And the cactus doesn't look AT ALL washed out and its so much sharper. Remember - all shots were done at basically the same time. The <strong>Canon</strong> only required 1/60th of a second to take the cactus - thats half the time the <strong>K800i</strong> and a quarter of that required by the <strong>Nikon</strong>!</p>
<p>If you want to be even more impressed - try viewing those images at full size from the Flickr Account (click on the images to go to their Flickr page). The <strong>K800i</strong> photo's are in my account and the <strong>Nikon</strong> &amp; <strong>Canon</strong> ones are in my Girlfriends account.</p>
<p>One final point - the <strong>Canon</strong> wasn't even in TOP quality. Those shots were taken with JPG compression (it can do RAW) and they're 'only' at 8 Megapixels (only, ha!)&nbsp; - we've not really felt the need to push it up to its maximum 10 Megapixels yet!</p>
