<p>Every Drupal developer/hacker knows (or should know!) about the fantastic API Documentation the project has. This growing collection of documentation is one of the top reasons that Drupal continues to grow and expand as quickly as it does. It makes it very inviting for engineers to start getting savvy.</p>
