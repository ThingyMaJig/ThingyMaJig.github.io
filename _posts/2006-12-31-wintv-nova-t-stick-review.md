<p>Christmas is over and, as usual, I think of a really good present to ask for too late&hellip; But I don't mind if I give myself a late present ;-)</p>
<p>I used to use an old <strong>WinTV Theatre</strong> PCI Card but I watched so little telly that I decided to remove it and use the space for making the computer lighter. My new toy is USB (2.0). It means I can also use it on my <strong>Mac Book Pro</strong> (once I get it back from Apple - <a title="Broken Macbook Hard Disk" href="/blog/30-12-2006/mac-book-pro-hard-disk-failure">they're still repairing my broken hard disk!</a>).</p>

<h2><a title="Product Page" href="http://www.hauppauge.co.uk/pages/products/data_novatstick.html">The device</a></h2>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised at <strong>how small it is</strong>! Its pretty much the same size as my thumb. One end has a male USB plug, the other has a female coax hole. It also looks like it has IR receiver points on it too, although <strong>it doesn't come with a remote</strong></p>
<h2>The Installation</h2>
<p>3 words - <strong><em>Piece Of Piss</em></strong></p>
<p>Appologies if that language offends - but it really is that easy</p>
<ol>
    <li>Put in the CD.</li>
    <li>Plug the device into a USB 2.0 socket (NOT A HUB)</li>
    <li>Tell Windows to automatically search for drivers (but &quot;Not this time&quot; to the Windows Update searching). This causes it to look on the CD when it fails to find any pre-existing ones on the system.</li>
    <li>Repeat step 3 for all the new hardware (there are about 4 to 5 bits from the main stick and IR receiver to a few HID components).</li>
    <li>Run Setup.exe on the disk and install the software you want</li>
    <li>Search for channels and watch them!</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok - the last step I've simplified&hellip; Let me explain!</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<div style="float: left; width: 170px;">[adsense:160x600:6965419571]</div>
<p>See, I bought this in Wales when visiting a relative who is about 6 miles from the Cardiff transmitter. Upon scanning for stations using the provided 5 inch piece of stiff wire on a small stand the size of a 2p coin I managed to find about 40 stations (consisting of Free TV, Pay TV and Radio). This was indoors on the ground floor using a laptop with a tiny aerial balanced on the table next to me. VERY easy and the picture quality was nigh on flawless. <strong>I was genuinely stunned!</strong>.</p>
<p>Now I'm home&hellip; My PC is on the 1st floor about 10 miles from Crystal Palace Transmitter (and about 20 miles form Bluebell Hill transmitter - for what that's worth... It only transmits about 6 stations!). I've heard that on a good day you can actually visually SEE Crystal Palace Transmitter from where I live, albeit out the back window - not the front where I am.</p>
<p>I plugged in the dinky little aerial and scanned after doing the same install procedure I used on my Laptop. Nothing - no frequencies were considered present, let alone strong enough to be locked onto. Bugger&hellip;</p>
<p>Ok - I have 2 spare aerials. 1 with a power booster but was produced before the invention of Digital Terrestrial TV, the other newer but not booster. I tried those but I still got no locked signals - although the strength improved ever so slightly. Bugger squared!</p>
<p>Well after going to Bluewater to get <a title="Dead Mac Book Pro" href="http://www.thingy-ma-jig.co.uk/blog/30-12-2006/mac-book-pro-hard-disk-failure">my dead Mac Book Pro sent back to Apple</a>, I popped into Curry's and bought an <strong>One For All</strong> signal boosting aerial designed for use with Freeview boxes and DVB-T reception. Looks very stylish I must say&hellip; Didn't help a bit, but it looks nice! Saying that, at least now the scanning actually considers some frequencies <em>PRESENT</em> - it just doesn't consider 19% strength anywhere near enough to consider locking onto!</p>
<p>So currently I am sitting here typing this blog message feeling quite frustrated. I have one piece of technology somewhere in Apple's hands being repaired and another sitting here blissfully unaware that Crystal Palace is blasting out digital signals 10 miles away, even with a decent booster!</p>
<p>I've posted for help on <a title="Nova T-Stick, No signal..." href="http://www.hauppauge.co.uk/board/showthread.php?t=10115">the Hauppauge Forum</a> and am waiting for advice there - but any here will be just as appreciated!</p>
