excerpt: <p>Last week (Thursday I think) I worked late and ended up walking from work
  (near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbican_tube_station">Barbican Tube
  Station</a>, London) to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Bridge_tube_station">London
  Bridge Station</a> (about a 35 minute walk if you know the back-roads). Putting
  aside the fear of being mugged down an alley somewhere, I quite like walking through
  London when its dark. The lights often look beautiful.

Here are some photo's of London-by-night&hellip;</p>

<p>These were taken using my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_K800">Sony Ericsson K800i</a>. I'm always impressed by the quality of the camera considering that its a phone!</p>
