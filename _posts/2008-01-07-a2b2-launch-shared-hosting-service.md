<p>Their <a title="Shared Hosting packages offered by A2B2XS" href="http://www.a2b2xs.co.uk/hosting">shared packages</a> include LiteSpeed Webserver 3, PHP 5, MySQL 5, SVN, Zend Framework &amp; more. This is MORE than enough to run a cheap and cheerful drupal site on!</p>
<p>I would advise emailing their <a title="A2B2XS Hosting Enquiry" href="mailto:sales@a2b2xs.co.uk?subject=Hosting%20Enquiry">sales team</a> before hand to check if they actually SUPPORT a drupal site, however on my A2B2 VPS, this drupal blog runs perfectly - and I get nearly over 6,000 page impressions a day. Any support requests are dealt with swiftly and politely. I cannot recommend them enough!</p>
