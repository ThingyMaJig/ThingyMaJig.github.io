<p>A project I've been working on for months, recently accelerated with the assistance of two newly employed colleagues (who are picking up this Drupal thing VERY quickly!) have meant that <a href="http://www.sportbusiness.com">www.sportbusiness.com</a> has finally moved from an old Solaris and Oracle setup with no server management or backup facility to a nice shiny new one with a company called <a href="http://www.rackspace.co.uk/">Rackspace</a>.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>We've had a server with Rackspace for over a year and its been fantastic. I think we've had a total of 1 hour of unplanned outtage which was caused by an issue outside of their control. Its such a weight off my mind to have such a large website of over 24,000 news articles (not all currently published due to Google Indexing) onto a proper setup.</p>
<p>Anywho - please go and visit <a href="http://www.sportbusiness.com/">Sport Business</a>'s website and see what you think. Its a b2b type website  but has LOADS of news about the sport's industry</p>
<p>While you're at it - why not visit some of the other site's I've worked with?
