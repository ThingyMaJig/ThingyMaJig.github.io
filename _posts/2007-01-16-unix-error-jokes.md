<p>While <a title="UNIX Error Jokes" href="http://digg.com/linux_unix/UNIX_Error_Jokes">Digging for fun</a>, I found this site about unix jokes. I'm always up for a laugh!</p>
<p><em><a href="http://vipinsagar.net/2006/11/22/unix-error-jokes/">http://vipinsagar.net/2006/11/22/unix-error-jokes/</a></em></p>

<p>Naturally, I'm a geek and found these following joke-errors VERY funny&hellip;</p>
<blockquote cite="http://vipinsagar.net/2006/11/22/unix-error-jokes/">
<p>The following Unix puns were distributed on the Usenet, without an attributed author. They work with the C shell.</p>
<pre language="bash">
 % rm meese-ethics
   rm: meese-ethics nonexistent
 % ar m God
   ar: God does not exist
 % "How would you rate Dan Quayle's incompetence?
   Unmatched ".
 % ^How did the sex change^ operation go?
   Modifier failed.
 % If I had a ( for every $ the Congress spent, what would I have?
   Too many ('s.
 % make love
   Make: Don't know how to make love. Stop.
 % sleep with me
   bad character
 % got a light?
   No match.
 % man: why did you get a divorce?
   man:: Too many arguments.
 % ^What is saccharine?
   Bad substitute.
 % %blow
   %blow: No such job.
</pre>
<p>These attempts at humor work with the Bourne shell:</p>
<pre language="bash">
 $ PATH=pretending! /usr/ucb/which sense
   no sense in pretending!
 $ drink < bottle ; opener
   bottle: cannot open
   opener: not found
 $ mkdir matter; cat >matter
   matter: cannot create
</pre> </blockquote>
