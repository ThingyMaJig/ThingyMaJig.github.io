<p>I just wanted to quickly setup a reminder on my mac (in this case that Star Trek was on in ten minutes - I know, I'm a geek!). It dawned on me that I didn't know a way to do this off the top of my head.</p>
<p>After a little Googling and trial and error, I found that the awesome <a href="http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/quicksilver" title="Quicksilver for OS X">Quicksilver</a> could execute timed events!</p>
<p>It's a little convoluted, however here is the process...</p>
<!--break-->
<ol>
    <li>Bring up Quicksilver, in my case it's Ctrl + Space</li>
    <li>Press '.' (dot) to enter text entry mode.</li>
    <li>Type in a message, for example, Star Trek on at 19:00 on Virgin1.</li>
    <li>Press Tab, this takes you to the next operator.</li>
    <li>Press Ctrl+Enter and start typing either &quot;Delay&quot; or &quot;Time&quot; and select the option.</li>
    <li>Press Tab</li>
    <li>If you used Delay, enter the period (eg 3s, 5m, 1h). If you used Time, enter a valid time (eg 18:59).</li>
    <li>Press Enter!</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it - job done. At that time, Quicksilver will execute that command on your behalf. You could even use it as a reminder to go to bed (for those late night coding sessions that always go on longer than intended), or just get up and move around at work.</p>
<p>I'll probably get loads of comments about paid-for apps or even free ones which do this, but I didn't want to have to install yet another app.</p>
