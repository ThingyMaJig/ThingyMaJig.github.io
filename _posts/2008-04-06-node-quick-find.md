<p>This may be useful for a site or it may not. For example, it probably wouldn't benefit a blog so much as the user would need to know the title of the blog entry they're looking for. I am using it for a suite of sites I'm developing for <a title="Dark Basic Pro stuff on Thingy Ma Jig" href="http://www.thingy-ma-jig.co.uk/tags/dbp">Dark Basic Pro</a>. The site it was originally intended for is the <a title="Dark Basic Pro API" href="http://api.dbp-site.com/">API</a>, however I've enabled it for 2 of the other 3 (<a title="Dark Basic Pro Codebase" href="http://codebase.dbp-site.com/">Codebase</a> and <a title="Dark Basic Pro Challenges" href="http://challenges.dbp-site.com/">Challenges</a>).</p>
<p>It's probably around about this point that someone will point out that it's been done before. If it has then I was clearly typing the wrong keywords into Google and Drupal Search!</p>
<p>I'm also keen to extend the features of this module so feature requests and suggestions are welcome.</p>
