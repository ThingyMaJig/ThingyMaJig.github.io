<p>This theme is compatible with all (known/common/tested) browsers except IE6. It <strong>mostly</strong> works in IE6 except the footer top border goes full width rather than insetted and, randomly, the left column jumps around!</p>
<p>The theme is completely <strong>XHTML 1.0 Strict</strong> compliant and validates with the <strong>W3 Validator</strong>.</p>
<p>The theme comes in a floating width version - I might work on a fixed with... Not sure yet.</p>
<p>In terms of SEO (mentioned earlier) it is quite friendly as, apart from the header coming first, the content section comes first the HTML and the menu's come later on.</p>
<p>Any thoughts? You can find the theme's project page on Drupal.org under <a title="Abessive" href="http://drupal.org/project/abessive">Abessive</a>.</p>
