<p>&nbsp;How do you find &quot;all&quot; the Drupal sites that Google knows about?</p>
<p>A post on <a href="http://drupal.org/node/36748">drupal.org suggests Add New Comment</a>, but that wont be entirely accurate. So far I have come up with a search that lists all sites with a User Account page on user/login:</p>
<pre>
intitle:"User account" inurl:"user/login"
</pre>
<!--break-->
<p>Or you can use this link to <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=intitle:%22User%20account%22%20inurl:%22user/login%22">search for drupal sites in Google</a>.</p>
<p>I am aware this only lists sites with user login linked to somewhere and not blocked by Robots.txt.</p>
<p>I have also seen suggestions that looking for a CSS file might work, however with Drupal's CSS aggregation, this could be difficult.</p>
<p>Please share any alternatives, my search above (currently) shows around 496,000 (on Google UK). How can we make this better?</p>
