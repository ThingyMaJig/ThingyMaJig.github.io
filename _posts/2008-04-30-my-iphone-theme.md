<p>I treated myself to a nice new <strong>iPhone</strong> last week and am LOVING it!</p>
<p>My phone is jailbroken and unlocked now (using <a title="iPhone PwnageTool" href="http://wikee.iphwn.org/">PwnageTool</a>). This means I can run all kinda of funky apps and games. I decided recently to design my own theme to make my phone feel more like &quot;mine&quot;. Here are some screenshots.

<p>Unfortunately the Weather Icon appears to be locked to that annoying 23C icon... UNLESS you decide that you're in the US. Yup - if you change your Internationalization settings to US then the Weather icon will change! I will include the icon in the future when it gets released on my friends site.</p>
<p>Without further ado - here are some teaser screenshots!</p>
