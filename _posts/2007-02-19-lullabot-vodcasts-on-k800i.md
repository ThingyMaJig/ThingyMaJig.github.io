<p>This morning I decided to watch the <a title="Upgrading from Drupal 4.7.x to 5.x" href="http://www.lullabot.com/videocast/upgrading_from_drupal_4_7_x_to_drupal_5_x">Lullabot Drupal 4.7.x to 5.x Conversion Tutorial</a>. Thing is - my work PC doesn't have sound plus it's not ideal to watch a video and work on the same screen - not enough screen real estate.</p>

<p>I own a <em>Sony Ericsson K800i</em>, and have done for almost a year. Personally I think it's the best phone I've ever owned. I know it can play video's, however the one from the Lullabot site is going to be WAY too high quality for playback on a mobile phone. <strong>PSP Video 9</strong> to the rescue!</p>
<h2>How?</h2>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; float: right;">[adsense:336x280:9994499560]</div>
<p>A quick Google turned up this page: <a title="How to encode video for SE Handphones" href="http://forums.asia.cnet.com/showthread.php?t=2655"> How to encode video for SE Handphones</a>. This has a very thorough settings list for video and audio configuration.</p>
<p>I chose to use <a title="Get PSP Video 9 here for free" href="http://www.pspvideo9.com/">PSP Video 9</a>  which is a completely free video converter for converting videos into MP4.</p>
<p>I started with the highest quality video settings recommended by the above <em>How To</em>. This is:</p>
<ul style="clear: right;">
    <li>
    <h3>Video Settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mode:</strong> SP &gt; A-VBR</li>
        <li><strong>Bitrate:</strong> 192 kbps</li>
        <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 176 X 144</li>
        <li><strong>Framerate:</strong> 14.985 fps</li>
        <li><strong>Passes:</strong> 2</li>
        <li><strong>Min Rate:</strong> 48</li>
        <li><strong>Max Rate:</strong> 256</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Audio Settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bitrate:</strong> 48 kbps</li>
        <li><strong>Channels:</strong> Stereo</li>
        <li><strong>Sample Rate:</strong> 32000 Hz</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>One thing to note about <em>PSP Video 9</em> is that its profiles are designed to work for a widescreen PSP with considerably more &quot;horsepower&quot; than a mobile phone. It took me a few minutes to realise that I can manually edit the contents of the drop down boxes.</p>
<p>After setting the above configuration as a profile, I set the program going on the 38Mb Lullabot tutorial video. It took my work machine (P4 2.8Ghz, 1Gb RAM) about 5 minutes to do the 2 pass convert. I checked it out using <a title="VideoLAN - a free all-pupose player" href="http://www.videolan.org/">VideoLAN (a free all-pupose player)</a> before loading it onto the phone and it worked fine.</p>
<p>I plugged the phone into the PC using the provided USB cable and copied the now 15Mb (less than half the original size) video onto the memory card. I then opened the video using the <em>Video Player</em> option under <em>Entertainment</em>. After setting it to fullscreen and landscape, I watched and listened away while typing up this blog entry!</p>
<p>I am going to use this same process to convert up some video's I'll be recording using my <a title="Nova Stick T Review" href="/blog/31-12-2006/wintv-nova-t-stick-review">WinTV Nova Stick T</a>. This should make my daily commute MUCH more bearable!</p>
