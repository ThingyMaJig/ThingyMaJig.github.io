<p><strong>About the screensaver</strong></p>
<p>This started out as my entry for the <a title="Fireworks Challenge" href="http://www.dbp-site.com/challenges/fireworks-display">Fireworks Challenge</a> and I decided to build upon it to make a screensaver of it. Its pretty simple - no sounds (sounds in screensavers annoy me!), a city made of white boxes and brightly coloured fireworks</p>
<p>The challenge was actually back in June 2006 and its only recently, with fireworks going off outside, that I've decided to finish it!</p>

<h2>How to install</h2>
<p>Just download the screensaver, double click the self-extracting file and you'll see a nice new screensaver. Press right mouse button on it and select install and windows will add it to your list. There are no settings yet (hopefully there WILL be some soon!). It will automatically try to pick a suitable resolution. If it complains about DirectX, see the requirements.</p>
<h2>Requirements - important</h2>
<p>I have placed instructions on how to fix the december DirectX issue <a href="http://www.thingy-ma-jig.co.uk/projects">here</a>. Basically, the latest version of <a href="http://www.thingy-ma-jig.co.uk/tags/dbp">DBP</a> requires one of the latest installs of DirectX 9.0c (yup, there is more than one!)</p>
