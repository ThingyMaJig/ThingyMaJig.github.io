<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>This was a tech-demo I quickly made using only dark basic professional. I used no external media makes - the whole thing is purely coded. It simulates flying - allbeit in a rather uncontrolled fashion - down a wormhole. I am going to turn this into a proper screensaver at some point.</p>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>
<p><a title="Flying down the wormhole" border="0" href="http://i.thingy-ma-jig.com/sites/thingy-ma-jig.co.uk/files/images/ss_0.jpg" class="fancybox"><img alt="Wormhole Screenshot Thumbnail" src="/sites/thingy-ma-jig.co.uk/files/images/ss_0.thumbnail.jpg" /></a></p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>There are no <em>controls</em> to speak of - however you can hold <strong><em>s</em></strong> to see your framerate (I get about 600). Spacebar will take a screenshot (saved as a bitmap in the EXE's folder) and the Escappe button quits (why would you want to do that?)</p>
<h2>Sourcecode</h2>
<p>This is an open-source program, so if you own Dark Basic Professional (or you just like reading someone else's code), then you are completely free to tweak away or use bits of it in your own program. It'd only be polite to credit my work though!</p>
