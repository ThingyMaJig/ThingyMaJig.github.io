excerpt: <p>We use NTL at home and recently they have been quite inconsistent when
  it comes to speed. Fair enough, when they upgraded us for free from 2Mb to 4Mb,
  I can accept a little slow down while the techies get on and sort the network out
  - but since friday our internet connection has stopped me from getting to one or
  two of the sites I works with, including this one! The one I was most concerned
  about was <a href="http://www.sportbusiness.com">www.sportbusiness.com</a> which
  was recently moved onto a new server over the weekend. Just when I needed (not wanted,
  NEEDED) to get to it - NTL stop me getting there.</p>

<p>We use NTL at home and recently they have been quite inconsistent when it comes to speed. Fair enough, when they upgraded us for free from 2Mb to 4Mb, I can accept a little slow down while the techies get on and sort the network out - but since friday our internet connection has stopped me from getting to one or two of the sites I works with, including this one! The one I was most concerned about was <a href="http://www.sportbusiness.com">www.sportbusiness.com</a> which was recently moved onto a new server over the weekend. Just when I needed (not wanted, NEEDED) to get to it - NTL stop me getting there.</p>
<p><strong>After much investigation, I've rounded the problem down to the NTL cache/proxy server's</strong></p>
<p>I did all the modem and router restarting malarky and thanks to some suggestions over at <a href="http://forum.thegamecreators.com/?m=forum_view&t=88071&b=2&p=0">The Game Creators Geek Cultre Forum</a>, I managed to reconnect to these sites using some alternative proxy servers.</p>
<p>To do this, I went to connections settings in Firefox (from Tools > Options). I then selected manual configuration and ONLY in the HTTP box, I started entering proxy server addresses which I found at <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robin.d.h.walker/cmtips/trancache.html">a fellow NTL-er's page about transparent proxy's</a>. I'm currently using the 1st manchester proxy and its working faster than the bromley ones ever did!</p>
<p>I wonder if its just me thats having this problem&hellip;</p>
