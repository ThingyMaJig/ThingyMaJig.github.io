<blockquote><p>We're pleased to announce the availability of the second Drupal 5 release candidate. We fixed most (if not all) pressing issues so we'd like you to help us test the stability, correctness and performance of this release so we can iron out the remaining issues. After 7-8 months of hard work, we're almost there, folks! And it is going to be a release which we can be really proud of.</p>
