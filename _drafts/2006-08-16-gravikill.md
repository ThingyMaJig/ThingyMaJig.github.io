<p><strong>About the game</strong></p><p>GraviKill started out as an experiment with the effect of a gravity field on a moving item.

Player 1 uses Q/A for up and down and player 2 uses O/L. Player 1 uses Z to fire and player 2 uses . (fullstop). For mouse control, move the mouse up and down and left click to fire. There are full control explanations in the readme html file included with the game along with explanations on how to change the default settings in the settings.ini file.</p><h2>Requirements - <em>important</em></h2><p>I have replaced the instructions on how to fix the december DirectX issue with those on the DBP page, <a href="/projects" title="Requirements">click here</a>. Apart from the latest DirectX 9.0c (December edition), the game is pretty light on graphical requirements - should work on any graphics card.</p>
