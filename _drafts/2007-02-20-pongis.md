<p>This is my entry into the Medialess Challenge set on February 2007 which was to re-invent a classic (rather than remake). This has turned into quite a fun game!</p>
<p>This game is not called <strong>Pongish</strong> - as I keep typing it!</p>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>
<p><a title="Pongis screenshot - mid rally" href="/projects/pongis/screenshot-1-rally"><img alt="Pongis screenshot" src="/sites/thingy-ma-jig.co.uk/files/images/ss1.thumbnail.png" /></a></p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>Player 1 uses left shift/ctrl and player 2 uses right shift/ctrl. This will move the paddle up and down its arc. Currently there are no options to set controls yourself - this will be in future versions. Score points by getting the ball off the side of the opponents screen edge (eg, player 2 scores by getting the ball off the left of the screen). No points if the ball drops down the gap between the floor and the screen edge.</p>
<h2>Requirements - IMPORTANT</h2>
<p>The instructions for getting a non-working game going on your machine can be found here: <a title="How to fix your game" href="/projects">How to fix your game</a>.</p>
<p>This game is configured to run at 800x600x16 - so it should run on any machine - as long as you have the latest version of Direct X 9.0c.</p>
